- 👋 Hi, I’m @AG-Git-Code
- 👀 I’m interested in all things crypto, dev, art, new concepts on traditional themes.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ember.js and beta testing with Cardstack.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on a book that I am writing.  It is a super-hero comedy and need an artist to help with comic book and nft designs.
